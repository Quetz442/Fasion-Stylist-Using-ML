1000 rows dataset for running an ml model that recommends fashion based on seasonal colour
fields: 
seasonal colour (spring,summer,autumn,winter),
complimentary colours
recommended colour combinations
the entries should be accurate and please no wrong info
give directly downloadeable csv file




analyse this dataset and give a good ML Model for fashion recommender based on bodyshape
using random forest classifier and python
i want to compile and run this code in google colab using the same dataset
give to versions of code:
one which will have sample example in itself
and one where the user will enter the body shape and optionally also the occassion(this is an optional choice for the user)
the output should be as follows:

Top:(recommended)
Bottom:(recommended)
Outerwear:(recommended)
Dress:(recommended)




create .jsx component having 3 sections :
1. body shape analysis
accept image from user which will be sent to a backend api for analysis
or accept measurement from user for shoulder,bust,waist,hips which will also be sent to a backend script for processing
or select from 5 bodyshapes hourglass,pear,apple,inverted triangle,rectangle which will also be sent to a backend script for processing
provide button called recommend to run an ML model in backend that displays the text

2. seasonal colour analysis
accept image from user which will be sent to a backend api for analysis
or accept measurement from user for eye colour,haircolour,skin colour which will also be sent to a backend script for processing
or select from 4 seasons spring, summer, autumn, winter which will also be sent to a backend script for processing
provide button called recommend to run an ML model in backend that displays the text

3. occassion based recommendation
select from 5 occasions formal,casual,party,workwear,streetwear,ethnicwear which will also be sent to a backend script for processing
provide button called recommend to run an ML model in backend that displays the text

provide a button that would run processing to recommend any 2 or all 3 of the above at the same time

create 2 .jsx components
1 for UI
and another for styling
make sure the styling is also in .jsx
styling should be dark
white on black
aura style(purple accent)
use tailwind css
